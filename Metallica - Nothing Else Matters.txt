Em, D, C, G, A, B

Em                 D      C 
So close no matter how far
Em                    D          C 
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Em               D         C 
Forever trusting who we are
G   B            Em 
And nothing else matters

Em             D          C 
Never opened myself this way
Em                    D      C 
Life is ours, we live it our way
Em                    D       C 
All these words I don't just say
G   B            Em 
And nothing else matters

Em               D        C 
Trust I seek and find in you
Em               D         C 
Every day for us something new
Em              D          C 
Open mind for a different view
G   B            Em 
And nothing else matters

Chorus:
C A D                     C 
Never cared for what they do
A D                       C 
Never cared for what they know
A D      Em 
But I know

C A D                      C 
Never cared for what they say
A D                       C 
Never cared for what they play
A D                       C 
Never cared for what they do
A D                       C 
Never cared for what they know
A D      Em 
But I know

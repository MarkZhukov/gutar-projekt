Am, Dm, Em, Fmaj7

   Am 
For the love of god, will you bite your tongue  
Fmaj7 
Before we make you swallow it  
     Dm 
It's moments like this where silence is golden  
Em 
(And then you speak)  
 
Am 
No one wants to hear you  
Fmaj7 
No one wants to see you  
   Dm 
So desperate and pathetic  
I'm begging you to spare me  
    Em 
The pleasure of your company  
 
(When did the diamonds leave your bones?)  
Am 
I'm burning down every bridge we make  
Fmaj7 
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break  
Dm 
I'm bleeding out every word you said  
Em 
Go to hell for heavens sake (2x) 
 
(Go to hell for heavens sake)  
Am 
No one wants to hear you (Save your breath)  
Fmaj7 
No one wants to see you  
   Dm 
So desperate and pathetic  
You think that no one sees this  
  Em 
I think it's time you knew the truth  
 
Am 
I'm burning down every bridge we make  
Fmaj7 
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break  
Dm 
I'm bleeding out every word you said  
Em 
Go to hell for heavens sake (2x) 
 
When did the diamonds leave your bones  
Leave your bones  
             Am 
You're not a shepherd, you're just a sheep  
            Fmaj7 
I'll cut my depths of everyone you meet  
            Dm 
You're own flesh with no bones  
                 Em 
Feed them to the sharks  
And throw them to the wolfs  
 
Am 
I'm burning down every bridge we make  
Fmaj7 
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break  
Dm 
I'm bleeding out every word you said  
Em 
Go to hell for heavens sake 
 
Am 
I'm burning down every bridge we make  
Fmaj7 
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break  
Dm 
I'm bleeding out every word you said  
Em 
Go to hell for heavens sake

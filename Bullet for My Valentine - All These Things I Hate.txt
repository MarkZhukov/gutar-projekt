Em, D, C

Em    D 
Once more I'll say 
    C 
goodbye to you 
Em                 D 
Things happen but we 
             C 
don't really know why 
Em                   D 
If it's supposed to be like this 
C 
Why do most of us ignore 
    Em            D   C 
the chance to miss? Oh yeah 
 
Refrain 1: 
D                   Em 
Torn apart at the seams and 
      D            C 
my dreams turn to tears 
                     Em D 
I'm not feeling this situation 
C                 Em 
Run away try to find that 
     D             C 
safe place you can hide 
The best place to be when 
you're feeling like

Verse 3: 
Em    D 
Once more you tell 
      C 
those lies to me 
Em                  D 
Why can't you just be 
                 C 
straight up with honesty? 
Em 
When you say those 
       D 
things in my ear 
C 
Why do you always tell 
            Em        D 
me what you wanna hear? 
   C 
Oh yeah (yeah!)

make things hard to believe 
                     Em D

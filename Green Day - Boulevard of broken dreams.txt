Fm       Ab
I walk a lonely road,
    Eb            Bb          Fm
The only one that I have ever known.
           Ab
Don't know where it goes,
Eb               Bb             Fm
But it's home to me and I walk alone.

I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams,
Where the city sleeps
    Eb           Bb              Fm    Ab
And I'm the only one and I walk alone.

 Eb        Bb
   I walk alone,
           Fm    Ab
   I walk alone.

 Eb        Bb
   I walk alone,
          Ab/C
   I walk a...

Chorus:
  Db    Ab           Eb            Fm
     My shadow's the only one that walks beside me.
  Db    Ab      Eb               Fm
     My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating.
  Db     Ab      Eb               Fm
     Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me.
  Db      Ab     C
     'Til then I walk alone.

 Fm     Ab     Eb      Bb    Fm
   Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah,
        Ab     Eb      Bb
   Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah.

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind.
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone.

Read between the lines
Of what's fucked up and everything's alright.
Check my vital signs
And know I'm still alive and I walk alone.

   I walk alone,
   I walk alone.

   I walk alone,
   I walk a...

Chorus

   Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah,
        Ab     Eb
   Ah-ah, ah-ah.

           Bb
   I walk alone,
          Ab/C
   I walk a...


I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams,
Where the city sleeps
    Eb           Bb             Ab/C
And I'm the only one and I walk a...

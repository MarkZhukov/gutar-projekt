Em, Dm, A, D, C

Em
On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
D
You can listen to the engines moanin'
Out as one old song
A
You can think about the woman or the girl
You knew the night before

Em

Em
But your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always Do
D
When you're ridin' sixteen hours
And there's nothin' much to Do
A
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was through

Em

D              Em
Here I am, on the road again
D              Em
There I am, up on the stage
D              A
There I go, playin' star again
C           D             Em
There I go, turn the page

Em
So you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
D
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
A
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explode

Em

Em
Yeah most times you can't hear 'em talk
But other times you can
D
All the same old clich√©s:
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
A
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Em
Make your stand

D              Em
Here I am, on the road again
D              Em
There I am, up on the stage
D             A
Here I go, playin' star again
C           D             Em
There I go, turn the page

Em
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Dm
Every ounce of energy you try and give away
A
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play

Em

Em
Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed
D
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
A
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Rememberin' what she said
Em
What she said

D  Em }x2
D  A | C  D  Em

Yeah

D              Em
Here I am, on the road again
D              Em
There I am, up on the stage
D             A
Here I go, playin' star again
C           D             Em
There I go, turn the page
And there I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah
Here I go, yeah
Here I go, yeah
Here I go, yeah
There I go, there I Go
(And I'm gone)

Em                          Cm
 We hold in our hearts the sword and the faith
Em                            Cm
 Swelled up from the rain clouds move like a wraith
       G       G(sus)       Cadd9
 Well after all, we'll lie another day.
           G     G(sus)       Cadd9
 And through it all we'll find some other way
       Em               Cm
 To carry on through cartilage and fluid
         Em              Cm
 And did you come to stare or wash away the blood?


    G          G/F#       Em 
 Well tonight, well tonight will it ever come?
          C         G/B       
 Spend the rest of your days rockin' out 
      Am
 Just for the dead
    G   G/F#     Em
 Well tonight, will it ever come?
          C     G/B     Am
 I can see you awake anytime in my head


      C      Am7 
 Did we all fall down?
      C
 Did we all fall down?
     Am7
 Did we all fall down?

 Did we all fall down?
                C
 From the lights to the pavement
              Am7
 From the van to the floor
                C
 From backstage to the doctor
          Am7
 From the earth to the morgue
                      G
 Morgue.... Morgue.... Morgue

      G/F#      Em
 Well tonight, will it ever come?
              C          G/B          Am  
 Spend the rest of your days rockin' out just for the dead
   G   G/F#      Em
 Well tonight, will it ever come?
          C     G/B     Am
 I can see you awake anytime in my head
